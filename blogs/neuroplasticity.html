            "How does Neuroplasticity benefit people?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to change through growth reorganisation. 
            It has many benefits that include medical benefits such as recovering from strokes or injuries, and assisting those with learning disabilities. 
            It also includes benefits to our ability to learn and practice. 
            The process of repetition moulds neurons into new pathways that are better suited to that activity, allowing for better results going forward.

            "How would you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            First and foremost would be repitition. 
            The process of repeating an action or reviewing material reinforces it in your brain and makes accessing the relevant information easier. 
            One thing to keep in mind would be that the old adage "practice makes perfect" would imply that any practice is better than none. 
            This mindset can be detrimental since practicing something incorrectly will reinforce bad habits. 
            It is important to make sure each repitition is as accurate as is reasonable. 
            A better suited adage would be "perfect practice makes perfect."
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            A good example of this would be exercises at the gym. 
            Without good form, you run the risk of injuring yourself. 
            In order to prevent this it is recommended to take your time and focus on correct form rather than completing the exercise quickly. 
            When you plan to lift very heavy weights it is recommended to do practice reps with negligible weight in order to reinforce correct form beforehand.

          <p class="paragraph">
            It is always a great idea to get a good sleep, not only for the obvious health benefits, but also because a well rested brain will be much more susceptible to beneficial activities. 
            Explanding your vocabulary or using your non-dominant hand to do things are good for engaging your brain in ways you're not used to. 
            For a more fun approach, I would recommend playing engaging games like chess or puzzle games like platformers. 
            There are plenty of eye-hand coordination activities like juggling that also work well for increasing neuroplasticity.

            "What is 'Growth Mindset' and why is it relevant?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Growth Mindset embodies the concept of "If I believe I can do then I will do it". 
            When we think we cannot accomplish something that mindset often restricts the efforts we put forth, stopping us from even trying in the first place. 
            Adopting a growth mindset means that you are only limited by how far you want to take yourself and how much effort you want to put into something.

          <p class="paragraph">
            Nothing suprised me while researching growth mindset, although I did realise that I have always had a bit of a fixed mindset. 
            I find I tell myself that something is beyond my abilities quite often, being unwilling to work towards something I know to be too bothersome or difficult to acheive. 
            I would like to challenge myself more and get out of that mindset.
