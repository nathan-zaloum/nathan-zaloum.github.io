            During my Game Development course I was staying late to code a small game. 
            I was staying late because I was getting an error that I just couldn't figure out. 
            I was getting super frustrated and decided to just go home. 
            Coming back in the next day I took a quick glance at my code and realised that there was one letter that was lower case instead of upper case.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            ONE letter...
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            During the process I tried googling the error message, but because it was a non specific error there was no easy answer online. 
            I tried putting in console messages to see where the code was bottle-necking, to no avail. 
            I had also asked some classmates if they knew what was causing it, but noone knew.
            It was only after stepping back and taking a fresh look the next day did the problem get solved.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            This error was really frustrating because there was nothing to go off of to find the issue. 
            I was only lucky to have randoomly spotted the problem, which made the previous day of frustration quite bitter. 
            Moving forward I have been alot more careful with writing my code.

            One time I was coding an AI for a game that needed to be able to speak random lines of dialogue. 
            The problem was that I didn't want to have to write a whole bunch of dialogue options for the AI to pick from. 
            As a workaround I made a function that created new dialogue based on a few variable sentence structures with a mix of word types. 
            This meant that by inputing a few variables for each word type (like verbs or adjectives) I could generate hundreds of different sentences.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            This problem was less of a code problem and more of an automation problem. 
            Fortunately I only needed to apply my existing know how to implement the solution.

          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Pseudocode:</b> I don't often use pseudocode as I'm quite confident with my general coding know how. 
            However, I do use pseudocode when I am planning out a chunk of code with a very involved process, just to make sure I understand the steps my code will take.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Trying Something:</b> I do this all the time, often in conjunction with Googling. 
            Especially when it comes to aesthetic changes, I will just try out variations and see the result.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Rubber Ducky Method:</b> Rather than with an object, I have the habit of pacing my room and explaining my code to noone, making sure I understand my own code. 
            I will also do this when thinking through code I need to write.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Reading Error Messages:</b> Error messages tell you when there is a problem so not reading them is just asking for trouble. 
            Most error messages can be Googled to find out what is wrong, recognising different types of error message can help you quickly pinpoint where a problem might be.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Console.logging:</b> I use logging when my code is going wrong but I don't know where exactly. 
            Adding logs after lines of code can help you figure out if that line of code is run or not, since if the log appears in console it means the preceeding line completed.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Googling:</b> What more can be said, I am always Googling how to code something, how to fix a problem, you name it.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Asking your peers for help:</b> I am happy to ask peers for help, especially when I know they understand something better than me.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <b>Asking coaches for help:</b> I like to see if I can figure a problem out on my own first. 
            If not I will seek a peer. 
            If that doesn't help then I will go to a coach.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            <b>Improving your process with reflection:</b> I do take not of what works well for me and where I trip up. 
            So I try to focus on what I know well and try to avoid the same problem twice.
