            I had a teacher that was not providing our class with what was expected of the course, and of a teacher. 
            While the majority of the class felt the same way, not many people were willing to address the issue directly with the teacher and other faculty. 
            I decided to take it upon myself to lead the discussions and as a result gained a less than favourable impression in the eyes of the teacher. 
            I believe they viewed me as an instigator and classes going forward were more awkward for me in particular. 
            I don't regret taking the lead though as the situation improved for the class as a whole and I feel it unnecessary to be liked by everyone in my life.

            I'm pretty kiwi, through and through. I have a real "she'll be right" attitude and like to just let things happen naturally. 
            I do have distant roots in Lebanon (my last name is Lebanese) however, I have no real experience with the culture. 
            The most influence it has on my is having to explain the origins of my last name.

            I'm good with practical exercises but weak with theoretical lessons. 
            I am better with learning things I find fun and have a hard time focusing on things I don't find fun.
            In terms of my career, I have a broad skillset which makes freelancing a lot more flexible. 
            However, this also means it is quite the challenge to find specific work as my individual skills are lacking compared to the competition.

            My focus on practical exercises makes learning practical skills very easy. 
            This also means that when it comes to things like expressing myself, like through these 'Core' blogs, I have a harder time.
            I can definitely see myself putting off these things and taking longer to do them than the practical exercises.

            During a previous course we had to do a whole class project where we tried to make a VR game. 
            The biggest issue we came across was our distribution of skills. 
            We didn't have a good balance of skillsets and instead had plenty of artists or plenty of coders. 
            This lead to a lack of progression in the overall project and we were left with a shell of a game and couldn't complete the project.
            If we were to do it again I would emphasise the allocation of tasks by importance and sit down and discuss with everyone what roles needed to be done rather than what roles everyone wanted to do. 
            Overall, I think the project failure was a result of treating it as a class exercise rather than treating it as a professional project with deadlines and other expectations.
