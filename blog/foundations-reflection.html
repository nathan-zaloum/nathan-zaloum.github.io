          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            I much prefer practical activity over reflections like these. 
            While I knew I liked hands on work beforehand, I learnt that doing these reflections can feel like homework. 
            While I see the value in doing them I find it hard to motivate myself to do them.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            I communicate more poorly online than I do in person. 
            I had this thought in my previous online course but the disconnect from others online is quite noticeable. 
            I have never had an issue learning on campus and my previous online course had daily calls with the class to interact so not having much interaction with the others during this course left me feeling like I wasn't even really doing a course. 
            It's unfortunate that Covid forced the course online, since I don't think this would have been an issue otherwise.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Again a communication issue, I have a tendency to only communicate when communicated with. 
            This seems to be an online issue, as I never had this issue in person.

      <div class="content" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> <!-- Content: Question 2 -->
        <div style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px;">
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b><em>
            "What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            Our values determine our approach to other people, our tasks, and ourself. 
            They give us motivation towards learning and our code will often reflect our values, such as clean, well commented code reflecting an organised mindset and focus on order.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            Empathy allows us to better understand and communicate with our peers, letting us work better together and help each other learn and improve.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Self awareness allows us to better understand ourselves, showing us how and why we react the ways we do, letting us self-direct our learning and progress.

            "What has surprised you the most about the core learning?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            For me it would have to be the complexity (or more accurately the unfamiliarness) of the subject matters. 
            I have never heard the term 'neuroplasticity' before and my knowledge of EQ has been very surface level. 
            Also, I didn't expect to have to do so much mini essay writing with my reflections.

            "What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            For me it was the research and reflections. 
            I've never been one to write much and the whole process reminds me of homework I was assigned in highschool. 
            Since I understand the value in the subjects but lack a particular interest in them personally, I found it harder to get too in-depth with them.

          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b><em>
            "Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            I suppose part of it is to prepare for the intensity of the bootcamp. 
            The core learning seems to be geared towards improving a students basic learning abilities which will help them keep up with bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            Another reason would be in preparation for the workforce. 
            Since a large part of getting a job and thriving in the work environment lies in human skills instead of technical skills, the core learning helps with that.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Also as mentioned in the question about values, empathy, and self awareness, core learning improves our ability to learn the technical skills we will need as well.

            "Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
            Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? 
            Justify your answer."
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            I find this to be a rather difficult question to answer clearly. 
            For a foundational course it did pad out the technical concepts and gave time to reflect. 
            I also do understand the value it brings.
            However, for me personally I do much better with practical exercises. 
            Since the core learning was very wordy and personally unintersting, I found it hard to motivate myself to get that work done. 
            If I simply had practical work to do in that time, I think my engagement with the course would have been a lot higher and I think I would have been a lot more efficient with my time.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            I also think that I would have enjoyed it more if the foundations were on campus in an environment where I could easily bounce off of other people and talk about these things rather than just think about them. 
            Being online, I find it much harder to simply begin talking with people since we haven't had the opportunity to naturally interact. 
            I don't consider this a fault of the course though, as there isn't much to be done about Covid interferring with things.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            So ultimately, I don't consider it a waste of time but ill-suited for my prefered learning style, and only amplified by being forced online by unforeseen circumstances.
