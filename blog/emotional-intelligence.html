            "What is Emotional Intelligence?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Emotional Intelligence (or EQ) is one's ability to understand and manage one's own or others emotions. 
            It affects how we think and the actions we take.
            In my opinion, different to how IQ can be considered more rationally grounded and objective, EQ is subjective. 
            How we feel about something will differ from person to person, regardless of the facts of the matter. 
            To understand EQ is to understand not only how you feel about something but also how others feel. 
            After this understanding comes a logical decision made taking those feelings into account.

            "How is EQ different to IQ?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a score given based on tests that represent one's intelligence. 
            It often reflects one's ability to problem solve and is often used to better measure one's competency. 
            While IQ could be considered the basis for one's logic in decision making, EQ would be the basis for making decisions based on emotional understanding. 
            As I have said in the previous question, I believe IQ to be grounded in ration and objectivity, whereas EQ is grounded in emotion and subjectivity. 
            While the two take different approaches, ultimately when used together will a person make the best decisions.

            "Why is it important?"
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            EQ allows us to better understand ourselves and how to interact with others. 
            Without it we would be liable to make decisions that could harm ourselves or others without knowing how or why. 
            Often times our response to a situation will come from our emotions and without our understanding why. 
            This can lead to rash decisions that we wouldn't make normally. 
            If we understand why we react the way we do and why others react the way they do we can turn an emotional response into a more rational one.

            Finally, I would like to give some of my thoughts on EQ.
          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            In my experience, one of the best ways to understand EQ and IQ is to look at how we consume media. 
            Movies, for example, can be viewed through a subjective lens and an objective lens. 
            At the end of a movie you will have an initial feeling about what you have seen.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            "Did you enjoy it? Was it fun? Are you left wanting more? Were you bored? Have you wasted your money?" 
            These initial reactions are our emotional response.<br>
            When we ask ourselves why we liked or disliked it, we have to come up with explanations for our feelings. 
            These explanations are our rational response.<br>
            When discussing the movie with others, often times arguments form when people disagree on their views of the movie. 
            Most of the time we  butt heads over our emotional response.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            We try to explain why we felt the way we did, but end up disregarding ration that does not favour our emotions. 
            In these situations there is often never a clear resolution, only further hunkering down on our emotions and causing conflicts with each other. 
            Understanding your own and others emotional response to something allows you to separate those from the rational. 
            Ultimately, doing so will let you understand it's okay to think things like "I didn't like that but I can see why my friend did."<br>
            Working on our EQ helps us prevent conflict from escalating and teaches us to take a step back and understand things first. 
            Understanding that it's okay for people to have different emotional responses is very healthy.
