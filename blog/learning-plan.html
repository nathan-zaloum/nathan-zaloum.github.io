            I keep my eye on Slack and prepare myself for the weekly facilitator meetings. 
            If the workload starts to get too much then I will focus less on making things look good and instead focus on simply completing the tasks to an acceptable level.

            I have already worked as a Game Developer and an App Developer so I am now looking to add Web Development to my skillset. 
            I would love to be able to work as either a freelance developer or work for a company doing any of those professions.

          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            I don't think my strengths and limitations have changed from my Foundations Learning Plan above. 
            Though I do believe I will have a much better time with my limitations when it comes to Bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            My biggest strength will be my passion for and pre-existing experience with coding. 
            I often code in my free time anyway, so I look forward to doing lots of fun little projects.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            For limitations, it is a shame the cohort hasn't had much opportunity for interaction, so I think many of the group activities may be a little hard at first. 
            Also, while I have experience doing talks in front of others I haven't had to do so in a long time so I think the lightning talks will be a challenge to get used to doing again.

          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><b><em>

          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            From foundations I have learnt that I struggle with communication online. 
            Now that this issue has been made apparent to me I would like to work on improving it. 
            If Bootcamp stays online then I am hoping the increased interactions through lightning talks, group projects, and general increase in workload will help with this. 
            On the other hand, if Bootcamp ends up on campus then it will be much harder for me to work on this issue since I'm confident I have never had communication issues offline.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Also, like I said above, while I have talking experience, I know that public speaking is a skill that can degrade if not practiced regularly. 
            Bootcamp will be my opportunity to refamiliarise myself with that skill.

          <p class="paragraph">
            I expect there to be someone on campus (or available online) 9-5 to be able to ask questions and get help from. 
            I also expect the team as a whole to have competency in the things we will be learning and doing over Bootcamp.

          </em></b></p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            I expect myself to show up each day and stay the whole day, and sticking around to complete work if needed. 
            I also expect myself to meet deadlines or communicate why I have not. 
            If Bootcamp is online then I expect myself to have the same commitment, but from home instead.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            My commitment to how I will manage my workload is to focus on the tasks for each day and focus on completing them to a basic standard first. 
            Only if I have the spare time at the end will I revisit individual tasks to polish them. 
            My focus is completion and understanding over polish.
